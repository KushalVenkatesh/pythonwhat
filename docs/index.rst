pythonwhat
----------

The ``pythonwhat`` package helps you to write Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) for interactive Python exercises on the DataCamp platform.

- Check out https://authoring.datacamp.com to discover teaching on DataCamp.
- Visit https://authoring.datacamp.com/courses/sct.html to understand the concept of SCTs.

This documentation features:

- Articles that gradually expose you to all of `pythonwhat`'s functionality and best practices.
- A glossary with typical use-cases and corresponding SCT constructs.
- Reference documentation of all actively maintained ``pythonwhat`` functions.

If you are new to writing SCTs for Python exercises, work your way through the articles first.
The reference docs become useful when you understand all concepts but want to look up details on how to call certain functions.
